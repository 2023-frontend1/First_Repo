React is a JS library for building fast and interactive user interfaces for the web as well as mobile applications

Pros:
    - uses virtual DOM (a copy of the real DOM) which speeds up the app.
        
        [Any changes in the real DOM re-renders the whole DOM at once and that affects the efficiency of your server 
        loading cause it has to reload the whole page as browser can only read JS, HTML/CSS]

        [Virtual DOM has no direct access or change to the real DOM, that alone makes it extremely fast.]

        [And React only looks at the DOM elements which need to be updated then carry out the update for it 
        instead of re-rendering all of the elements]

    - can be used to create sophisticated UI for both desktop and mobile apps

    - reusable and useful components fro code maintenance. 

Cons: 

    - majority of the code is written in JSX, meaning HTML & CSS are part of the JS code.
        [This could be a problem because most other frameworks like to keep HTML separate from the JS code.]

    - React has a huge file size.
